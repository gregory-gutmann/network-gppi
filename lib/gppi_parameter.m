%% Get gPPI-Parameters% Gregory Gutman (14.11.22)%{Implementation took heavily from PPPI.m script written by Donald G. McLarenand Aaron Schulz as well as spm_peb_ppi.m written by Darren Gitelman.Comment edited for clarity. As scan timing instead of microtiming (which takes account for the different slices) was used, I tried to simplify thecode when possible. Also, I added an step of unwhitening the alreadywhitened roi-variable and the deconvoluted neural signal, as whitenening is again reintroduced in the computation of beta values.    $Id: PPPI.m    Copyright (c) 2011, Donald G.

This was also the case for the original PPPI structure. Maybe there is a bug in PPPI or this step is only relevant for a set-up structure that I don't use with maybe addition cofounds.%% ** Dopple-use of filtering and whiteningTarget eigenvariate is already filtered and whitened in eigenvariate.mbut all variates will again be fitered and whitened in in spm_spm.m when betas are computed. Temporal filtering twice has no relevant effect, but whitening twice does.Thats why I choose to unwhiten the already whitened roi-variable.Regarding the interaction between the deconvoluted neural signal and design vectors, the deconvoluted signal was unwithened before itsmultiplication with the design vectors. %% Create convolved explanatory {Hxb} variables in scan time(QQQ)Do have a closer overlap with the original PPPI scripts, I choose to implement a Hxb calculating based on microtime like in the originallibrary%% Control with gPPI-network originallyY sameC sameP very small difference  (neglible)PPI very small difference  (neglible)%% Control with PPIY very small difference  (neglible)C sameP very small difference  (neglible)PPI very small difference  (neglible) when also creating Hxb in  micro time%% Comparison convoluted(deconvoluted(Y)) with orig YSimilar but not the same.
